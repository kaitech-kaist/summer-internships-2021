# Summer internships 2021 💻

Here we provide an extensive list of internships for Summer of 2021, which you can keep track of!

If you seek information on how to do well in tech career, we recommend you to visit our [Kaitech Guide](https://kaitech-kaist.github.io/guide/). 

We encourage students to contribute to this list by submitting a pull request! As a university located in Korea, we also want our students to add local companies that are eager to hire interns. 

We are also open to new ideas and kindly discuss them if you have any. You can do so by opening a [thread](https://github.com/kaitech-kaist/summer-internships-2021/issues) (raising an issue in GitHub lingo) in this repo.
